# Indian-Currency-Classification

An application for classifying new indian currency notes using **random forest** classifier. It is implemented with the help of **opencv** and **scikit-learn** library. The dataset used for training consists of **1050** images of new currency notes(INR). It includes denomination of **10,20,50,100,200,500 and 2000** rupees notes(i.e. 150 each).

Here we use **hu moments**(shape), **haralick**(texture) and **colour histogram**(colour) as global features and **bag of visual words**(BOVW) with **SIFT** as a local feature descriptor. It is then trained using a random forest classifier, using scikit learn library.

Finally during **inference**, we extract the **rectangular ROI's** from the preprocessed input image using opencv(cropped rotated contour) and then use the trained model to **predict** the class labels.


## Dependencies
